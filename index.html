          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet are the three ways to style a webpage using CSS.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style and element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>External style sheets allow developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A wild card symbol or * selector applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>Selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declaration to affect multiple selectors.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together reducing repetition and extra lines of code.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages reusing or sharing pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines written or maintained.</li>
          <li>text-align: a positioning property, one way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>
          <li>The img(<>) selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>The period (.) designates an element as a class selector.</li>
          <li>auto value: The value of said property is adjusted automatically according to the content or the context of the element.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
          <li>Colors can be assigned by including semantic references such as "gray" or "blue" or through hex code (hex #).</li>
